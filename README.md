# Python Practice & Projects

This repository is a collection of Python projects and coding exercises completed as part of my early programming journey. The code here demonstrates my work with algorithms, data structures, problem-solving, and basic software design.

## Repository Structure

- **projects/**  
  Contains self-contained Python projects, each in its own subdirectory with code and documentation:
  - **ooclassifier/**: An object-oriented text classifier with preprocessing and evaluation tools.
  - **passwordvalidate/**: Password validation and secure password generation utilities.
  - **preprocess/**: A flexible text preprocessing script supporting multiple cleaning modes.
  - **unfairDice/**: Simulation of biased dice rolls and histogram visualization.
  - **word_frequency/**: Script to count word frequencies in a text file and output a frequency table.

- **exercises/**  
  A set of smaller coding challenges and algorithmic exercises, each in its own folder. These focus on fundamental programming concepts and problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to showcase my progress in learning Python and to demonstrate my ability to solve problems, write modular code, and implement basic algorithms.

## Getting Started

Each project includes its own README with usage instructions and details. To run a project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided.
