# python-pratice

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects and coding challenges Iâ€™ve worked when I first started learning programming. The problems and projects helped me practice algorithms, data structures, and general problem-solving. 
Includes solutions to problems as well as projects like classifiers, password validators, and scripts.
