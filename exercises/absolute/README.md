# Absolute Difference Calculator

This project contains a simple Python script that calculates the absolute difference between two integers provided as input. 

## How It Works

- The program reads two integers from standard input, separated by a space.
- It computes the absolute value of their difference.
- The result is printed to standard output.

## Example

**Input:**
```
7 3
```
**Output:**
```
4
```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 absolute.py
    ```
2. Enter two integers separated by a space when prompted.
3. The program will output their absolute difference.

## File Structure

- [`absolute.py`](soln/absolute.py): Main script for calculating the absolute difference.
