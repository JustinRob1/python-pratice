# Full Tank Problem

This project contains a Python script that solves the "Full Tank" problem, where you must determine the minimum time required to travel a given distance with a car that has a limited fuel tank capacity and a set of refueling stops.

## Summary

- You are given:
  - The total length of the journey (`l`)
  - The capacity of your fuel tank (`c`)
  - The number of refueling stops (`n`)
  - The time penalty for refueling (`t`)
  - The positions of the refueling stops

- The car starts at position 0 with a full tank and must reach the destination at position `l`.
- Each time the car runs out of fuel before reaching the next stop, it must refuel, incurring a time penalty.
- The goal is to compute the minimum total time to reach the destination.

## Example

**Input:**
25 10 2 5 10 20

**Output:**
30 


## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 full_tank.py
    ```
2. Enter the journey parameters and stop positions as prompted.
3. The program will output the minimum total time required to complete the journey.
