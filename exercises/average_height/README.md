# Average Height Calculator

This project contains a Python script that calculates the average of a list of integer heights and outputs the result rounded down to the nearest integer.

## How It Works

- The program reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input, representing heights.
- It computes the average of these numbers.
- The result is rounded down to the nearest integer using floor division and printed to standard output.

## Example

**Input:**
```
160 150 180 170
```
**Output:**
```
165
```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 average-height.py
    ```
2. Enter a list of space-separated integers when prompted.
3. The program will output the floored average of the input numbers.

## File Structure

- [`average-height.py`](soln/average-height.py): Main script for calculating the floored average height.
