# Bed Area Calculator

This project contains a Python script that calculates the area of a rectangle (representing a bed) given two opposite corners' coordinates.

## How It Works

- The program reads two lines of input, each containing two integers separated by a space. These represent the (x, y) coordinates of two opposite corners of a rectangle.
- It computes the width and height of the rectangle as the absolute differences between the corresponding coordinates.
- The area is calculated as `width * height` and printed to standard output.

## Example

**Input:**
```
1 2 4 6
``` 
**Output:**
```
12
```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 bed.py
    ```
2. Enter the coordinates of the two corners, one pair per line.
3. The program will output the area of the rectangle.

## File Structure

- [`bed.py`](soln/bed.py): Main script for calculating the rectangle area.
