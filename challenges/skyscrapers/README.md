# Skyscrapers Floor Counter

This project contains a Python script that calculates, for each floor from 0 up to the tallest skyscraper, how many skyscrapers reach at least that floor.

## Program Overview

- The program reads an integer `n` from standard input, representing the number of skyscrapers.
- It then reads `n` integers, each representing the height of a skyscraper.
- For each floor from 0 up to the maximum skyscraper height (exclusive), it outputs the number of skyscrapers that are at least as tall as that floor.

## How It Works

- The list of skyscraper heights is sorted.
- For each floor level, the script uses binary search to efficiently count how many skyscrapers are tall enough to reach that floor.
- The result for each floor is printed on a separate line.

## Example

**Input:**
5 3 1 4 1 5

**Output:**
5 5 3 2 1

*Explanation: For each floor from 0 to 4, the output is the number of skyscrapers with height greater than or equal to that floor.*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 skyscrapers.py
    ```
2. Enter the number of skyscrapers, followed by each skyscraper's height on a new line.
3. The program will output the count for each floor, one per line.
