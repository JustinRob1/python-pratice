# N-Sum Problem

This project contains a Python script that solves the N-Sum problem: given two integers `n` and `m`, the program finds the smallest possible subset of distinct integers from 1 to `n` whose sum is exactly `m`.

## Program Overview

- The program reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from standard input.
- It constructs a subset of distinct integers from the range `[1, n]` such that their sum equals `m`.
- The subset is built greedily, starting from the largest possible integer and working downwards.
- The program outputs the size of the subset and the subset itself in increasing order.

## Example

**Input:**
5 9 

**Output:**
2 4 5 

*Explanation: The subset {4, 5} sums to 9.*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 n_sum.py
    ```
2. Enter the input values as described above.
3. The program will output the size and elements of the subset.
