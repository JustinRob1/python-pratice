# Large Points

This project contains a Python script that determines whether a set of points are "Large" or "Small" based on their position relative to a set of circles.

## Program Overview

- The program first reads a list of circles, each defined by its center coordinates and radius.
- It then reads a list of points.
- For each point, the program checks if it lies inside or on the boundary of any of the circles.
  - If the point is inside or on any circle, it is classified as "Large".
  - Otherwise, it is classified as "Small".
- The result for each point is printed to standard output.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of circles.
2. The next `n` lines each contain three floating-point numbers: the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of a circle.
3. The following line contains an integer `m`, the number of points.
4. The next `m` lines each contain two floating-point numbers: the x and y coordinates of a point.

## Output Format

For each point, output either:
- `Large` if the point is inside or on any circle
- `Small` otherwise

## Example

**Input:**
2 0 0 2 3 3 1 3 0 0 3 3 2 2

**Output:**
Large Large Small

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 large_points.py
    ```
2. Enter the input as described above.
3. The program will output the classification for each point.
