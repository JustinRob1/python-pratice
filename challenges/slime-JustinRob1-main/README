# Slime Merging Problem

This project contains a Python script that simulates the merging of slimes according to specific rules.

## Program Overview

- The program starts with `n` slimes, each of size 1.
- It repeatedly scans the list of slimes from left to right.
- Whenever two adjacent slimes of the same size are found, they merge into a single slime whose size is the sum of the two.
- This process continues until no more adjacent slimes of the same size remain.
- The final sizes of the slimes are printed as space-separated integers.

## Example

**Input:**
5

**Output:**
2 3 

*Explanation: Starting with five slimes of size 1, the merging process results in slimes of sizes 2 and 3.*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 slime.py
    ```
2. Enter the number of slimes as a single integer.
3. The program will output the final sizes of the slimes after all possible merges.

## File Structure

- `slime.py`: Main script for simulating the slime merging process.
