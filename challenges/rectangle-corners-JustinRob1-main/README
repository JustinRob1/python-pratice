# Rectangle Corner Finder

This project contains a Python script that determines the coordinates of the missing fourth corner of a rectangle, given the coordinates of three of its corners. The rectangle's sides are parallel to the axes.

## Program Overview

- The program reads three pairs of integers from standard input, each representing the (x, y) coordinates of a rectangle's corner.
- It calculates the coordinates of the fourth corner, assuming the rectangle's sides are aligned with the x and y axes.
- The result is printed as two integers separated by a space.

## Example

**Input:**
1 2 1 4 3 2 

**Output:**
3 4

*Explanation: The missing corner is at (3, 4).*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 rectangles.py
    ```
2. Enter three lines, each with two space-separated integers representing the coordinates of a corner.
3. The program will output the coordinates of the missing fourth corner.
