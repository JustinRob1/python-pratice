# Plateau Length Finder

This project contains a Python script that determines the length of the longest plateau in a sequence of integers. A plateau is defined as a sequence of consecutive, identical numbers.

## Program Overview

- The program reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input.
- It scans through the list to find the longest contiguous subsequence where all numbers are the same.
- The length of the longest plateau is printed as output.

## Example

**Input:**
2 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2 1

**Output:**
4

*Explanation: The longest plateau is four consecutive 2's.*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 plateau.py
    ```
2. Enter a sequence of space-separated integers.
3. The program will output the length of the longest plateau.
