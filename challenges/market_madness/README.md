# Market Madness

This project contains a Python script that calculates the maximum possible profit from a single buy-and-sell transaction given a list of daily stock prices.

## Program Overview

- The program reads the number of days and a list of daily stock prices from standard input.
- It determines the best possible profit that can be made by buying on one day and selling on a later day.
- If no profit is possible, the output will be 0.

## How It Works

- The script keeps track of the minimum price seen so far as it iterates through the list of prices.
- For each price, it calculates the potential profit if the stock were bought at the minimum price and sold at the current price.
- It updates the maximum profit whenever a higher profit is found.

## Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer `days`, the number of days.
2. The second line contains `days` space-separated integers representing the stock prices for each day.

## Output Format

- A single integer representing the maximum profit achievable from one buy and one sell.

## Example

**Input:**
6 7 1 5 3 6 4

**Output:**
5

*Explanation: Buy at 1 and sell at 6 for a profit of 5.*

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python 3:
    ```sh
    python3 market_madness.py
    ```
2. Enter the number of days and the list of prices as described above.
3. The program will output the maximum profit.
